Memory Color Match Game

A color matching game built with HTML, CSS, and JQuery. 

<!-- Rules -->

- This game features a minimalist UI and simple design. The game begins with cards of the same color. 

- The player has to click on a card to reveal its color and click another card to try and match its color. 

- After clicking (2) a card, if the color of the card don't match, the colors are changed to black, to show the player that they clicked those card, but their colors did not match.

<!-- Process -->
The UI was fairly straight-forward for the app. A parent container div was used to nest all the elements of the app. The div with the ID of canvas was used to store all the card div, which represent each card. The finished div, is a section that appears when the player completes the game.
